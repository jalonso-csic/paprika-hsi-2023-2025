\# Quick start



\## Requirements

\- MATLAB R2025a

\- Toolboxes: Statistics and Machine Learning, Parallel Computing



\## Steps

1\) Clone the repo and open MATLAB.

2\) Add `code-matlab/` to the MATLAB path (or `addpath('code-matlab')`).

3\) Run the main script (to be added) to reproduce PCA, supervised CV and PLSR.

4\) Outputs will be written to `figures/` and `supplementary/`.



\## Notes

\- Large binaries (`.mat`, `.fig`, `.xlsx`, `.png`) are tracked via Git LFS.

\- A tiny sample dataset will be placed under `data-sample/` (not the full data).
